  <h2 align="center">A Dynamically Reloadable Interface for Libraries</h2>



## Features

- **Hot Reload :** Changes made to the library during runtime are visible
- **Platform Independent :** Works on all platforms Windows, Linux and MacOS
- **Inbuilt Parser :** Reads symbols from library and reloads them during runtime
- **Automatic Build :** The initial build is automatic and performed when the Premake script is run

  ## Use Cases for our Interface

- [An Application using OpenGL Graphics]( https://github.com/Anirudh-V-Gubbi/DRIL/tree/main/examples/OpenGL)
    - Visible changes are made and graphics are re-rendered during runtime with the help of our Interface
 
- [A Json Parser Application](https://github.com/Anirudh-V-Gubbi/DRIL/tree/main/examples/FileParser)
    - Files to be parsed can be modified or replaced during runtime with the help of our Interface
